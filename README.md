# usb-fingerprint-The USB Fingerprinting and Suspicious Device Detection Tool is a Windows-based cybersecurity project designed to monitor USB devices connecting to a computer, extract identity-based information, and evaluate whether the device behaves normally or shows indicators of suspicious activity. This project aims to reduce USB-based attack vectors such as BadUSB, HID spoofing, unauthorized data exfiltration, and rogue USB device injections. It provides students with deeper hands-on experience in endpoint security, device identification techniques, and behavior-based anomaly detection.

This system functions by continuously monitoring USB plug-in events using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). When a new device is connected, the program automatically captures attributes such as Vendor ID, Product ID, Serial Number, Manufacturer, and Device Model. These attributes form a unique "digital fingerprint" for each USB device. The fingerprint is compared with a locally stored database of previously authorized or known devices. If the connected device does not match any known fingerprints, the system categorizes it as “unknown” and logs the event for further inspection.

The project also includes a suspicious-behavior detection module. This module checks whether the device has missing values, mismatched vendors, inconsistent serial numbers, or unusual characteristics commonly associated with spoofed USB attacks. For example, if a USB reports no serial number or displays an unknown manufacturer, the system generates an alert indicating that the device may be unsafe or potentially malicious. These checks help identify devices that attempt to impersonate legitimate hardware.

All device activity is logged with timestamps into a security log file, enabling auditing and tracking of every USB connection event. Logs include details of the device fingerprint, detection status, and any warnings generated during analysis. This approach mimics the behavior of enterprise endpoint-protection solutions and provides students with insight into how actual security tools operate.

The project is developed in Python using Visual Studio Code. It uses widely adopted libraries such as wmi for Windows USB monitoring and JSON for maintaining a database of known devices. The modular directory structure ensures clean separation of concerns: device recognition, fingerprint generation, suspicious behavior detection, database handling, and logging. This makes the project easily maintainable, scalable, and extendable.

The tool can be enhanced to include real-time alerts, graphical dashboards, USB blocking features, or integration with centralized monitoring platforms. Advanced students may also expand the system with machine-learning-based anomaly models to classify devices based on historical behavior. For academic evaluation, the project provides an excellent demonstration of OS-level monitoring, device profiling, Python scripting, and practical cybersecurity defense mechanisms. It is highly relevant to modern security challenges and showcases a clear application of cybersecurity principles such as endpoint protection, threat detection, and digital forensics.
